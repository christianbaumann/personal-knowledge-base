# Job Interviews

#### When interviewing for a job, when asked the salary question, turn that back around on the interviewer (nicely)!

An experience shared: “This has worked for me on my last three jobs (one of them was a promotion) that I got. When does the interviewer ask the question: what salary are you looking for? instead of listing what you’re expecting to ask them instead.

I always start by explaining that I have been researching salaries in my field but wanted to know what they felt is a competitive salary for someone with my experience? (If this your first job interview or you’re going for an entry-level job that you don’t have experience in, you can always change the part about the experience to “this position”).

Oftentimes, they will give you the number that they are expecting to pay for that position; and every time I ask a potential employer it has been at least $5-$10k more then I was going to ever say.

This also helps you compare what they’re willing to pay vs whether that salary is worth the job. AND you don’t run the risk of underselling yourself! (If they’re expecting to pay $60k and you say $40k, they’re not going to correct you and also might think that you are not as qualified or have a high opinion of your own self worth).”
