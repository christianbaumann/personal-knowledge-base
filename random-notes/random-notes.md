### Estimates

> **Disclaimer about the numbers in this document**  
> All numbers in this text, for example, referring to times such as days, or refering to throughput, are etimates.  
> These numbers are wrong.  
> They are not a prediction. They are based on expertise, skill, ability, gut-feel, the situation, and all available information at that time. They are made at a time when the team had the least information available about the future. The team is not committed to meeting these numbers, and they can't be held responsible for not meeting these numbers.  
> Estimates are still useful, because they are rough figures that are put in here to have some kind of outlook to predict the future better. Also, these numbers enable and enhance conversations about the work.
